This plugin aims to make it easier to visualise a bundles contents and aid in troubleshooting and optimisation. If you know [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer/) then this plugin will be very familiar. Bundle contents is presented in a treemap that gives eash asset/folder an area relative to its size on disc.


# Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev parcel-plugin-bundle-visualiser
```

# Usage

The next time you run your parcel build in production mode (i.e. when NODE_ENV is 'production') a bundle report will be saved to `<project root>/report.html`

## Configuring report file locations

Provide `PARCEL_BUNDLE_VISUALISER_REPORT` environment variable and report will be written there.


# Interpreting results
When you open the `<project root>/report.html` in a browser you'll see a treemap that shows the contents of each bundle that parcel created in the last build. The area an asset takes up on screen is relative to the size of the asset (after any minification but before gzipping). Hover over treemap to see further details;
 - The current bundle/folder or asset file name
 - The path relative to the project root
 - The size of the asset (after any minification but before gzipping)
 - Bundles will also have an estimated gzip size. This is meant as a indicator (actual compression size will depend on your settings when serving the bundle)
 - Time taken to bundle. Not sure this is very useful but leaving it in for now - parcel bundles in parallel so actual total times will be much lower than the simple sums shown here.


# Release Notes
 - 1.1.2 Fixed script error in
 - 1.1.1 Report will now only be generated when NODE_ENV=production
 - 1.0.2 Removed '--visualise' cli arg until until bug [#6](https://github.com/gregtillbrook/parcel-plugin-bundle-visualiser/issues/6) is resolved
 - 1.0.1 Minor readme tweaks
 - 1.0 Required the passing of arg '--visualise' to parcel build command so that user can dictate when report is generated. Hence incremented major npm version as this is a breaking api change.
 - 0.8 Added onhover toolip showing stats (I dont expect these reports to be viewed on touch devices - if thats incorrect then let me know). Also added gzip size estimate for bundles.
 - 0.2 Initial POC
